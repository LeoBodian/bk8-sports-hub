        <h1>🛡️ Responsible Gambling Guide</h1>
        <p class="intro">Gambling should be an enjoyable form of entertainment, never a source of financial stress or personal problems. This guide provides essential information for responsible betting.</p>
      </div>

      <section class="guide-article">
        <article class="article">
          
          <h2>What is Responsible Gambling?</h2>
          
          <p>Responsible gambling means approaching betting as a form of entertainment while maintaining control over your gambling activities. It involves understanding the risks, setting limits, and recognizing when gambling stops being fun.</p>

          <p>Sports betting can be an exciting way to engage with your favorite sports, but it's crucial to gamble within your means and maintain a healthy relationship with betting activities.</p>

          <h2>Golden Rules of Responsible Betting</h2>

          <h3>1. Set a Budget and Stick to It</h3>
          <p>Before you place any bet, decide how much money you can afford to lose. This should be money set aside purely for entertainment—never funds needed for bills, rent, food, or other essential expenses.</p>
          
          <div class="tip-box">
            <h4>💡 Budget Setting Tips</h4>
            <ul style="padding-left: 20px; margin-top: 8px;">
              <li>Set a weekly or monthly betting budget</li>
              <li>Never increase your budget to chase losses</li>
              <li>Keep betting funds separate from daily expenses</li>
              <li>Track all your bets to monitor spending</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <h3>2. Set Time Limits</h3>
          <p>Gambling can be time-consuming. Set clear time limits for your betting activities and stick to them. Taking regular breaks helps maintain perspective and prevents gambling from affecting other areas of your life.</p>

          <h3>3. Never Chase Losses</h3>
          <p>One of the most dangerous behaviors in gambling is trying to win back money you've lost. Accept that losing is part of gambling, and never bet more than planned to recover losses. This cycle often leads to bigger losses.</p>

          <h3>4. Don't Gamble When Emotional</h3>
          <p>Avoid betting when you're:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Feeling stressed, anxious, or depressed</li>
            <li>Under the influence of alcohol or drugs</li>
            <li>Angry or upset about something</li>
            <li>Trying to escape personal problems</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Emotional gambling leads to poor decisions and increased risk of problem gambling.</p>

          <h3>5. Understand the Odds</h3>
          <p>Remember that bookmakers have an edge—they wouldn't be in business otherwise. Understanding that the house always has an advantage helps maintain realistic expectations about your betting outcomes.</p>

          <h3>6. Balance Gambling with Other Activities</h3>
          <p>Gambling should never be your only hobby or source of entertainment. Maintain a healthy balance with other activities, social relationships, work, and family time.</p>

          <h2>Warning Signs of Problem Gambling</h2>
          
          <p>It's important to recognize the signs that gambling may be becoming a problem. Ask yourself these questions:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Do you spend more money or time gambling than you intended?</li>
            <li>Have you tried to cut back on gambling but couldn't?</li>
            <li>Do you feel restless or irritable when not gambling?</li>
            <li>Do you gamble to escape problems or relieve negative feelings?</li>
            <li>Have you lied to family members about your gambling?</li>
            <li>Have you borrowed money or sold possessions to gamble?</li>
            <li>Has gambling affected your relationships, job, or studies?</li>
            <li>Do you feel the need to bet with increasing amounts of money?</li>
          </ul>
