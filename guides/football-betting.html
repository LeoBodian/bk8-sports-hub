      <section id="bet-types">
        <h2>Football Bet Types Explained: From Basics to Advanced</h2>
        <p>Understanding football bet types is essential for making informed decisions. BK8 offers both beginner-friendly markets and advanced options.</p>
        
        <h3>Match Result (1X2)</h3>
        <p>The match result market is the most straightforward option, allowing bettors to predict a home win, away win, or draw. It is ideal for beginners and commonly used in accumulator bets.</p>
        
        <h3>Asian Handicap</h3>
        <p>Asian handicap betting removes the draw outcome and applies a virtual goal advantage or disadvantage. This market is popular among experienced bettors because it balances odds and reduces risk in mismatched games. <a href="asian-handicap.html">Learn more about Asian Handicap →</a></p>
        
        <h3>Over and Under Goals</h3>
        <p>Over and under betting focuses on the total number of goals scored. Bettors can analyze team scoring trends, defensive records, and match tempo to identify value opportunities.</p>
        
        <h3>Both Teams to Score (BTTS)</h3>
        <p>This market requires both teams to score at least once. It is widely used in matches where both sides have strong attacking potential but inconsistent defenses.</p>
        
        <h3>Correct Score</h3>
        <p>Correct score betting offers higher odds by predicting the exact final score. While riskier, it can deliver strong returns when supported by detailed match analysis.</p>

        <h2>Football Betting Tips for Cambodian Bettors</h2>
        <p>Effective football betting relies on preparation, discipline, and realistic expectations.</p>
        
        <h3>Study Team Form and Injuries</h3>
        <p>Analyzing recent performances, injuries, and suspensions provides insight into how a team is likely to perform. This information is especially useful for pre-match betting.</p>
        
        <h3>Understand Odds and Value</h3>
        <p>Odds reflect probability, not certainty. Identifying value bets where odds do not fully reflect match conditions can improve long-term results.</p>
        
        <h3>Manage Your Bankroll</h3>
        <p>Setting limits and managing stake sizes helps control risk. Consistent bankroll management keeps football betting enjoyable and sustainable.</p>
        
        <h3>Use Accumulators Wisely</h3>
        <p>Accumulator bets offer higher potential returns but come with increased risk. Using them selectively can balance excitement and discipline.</p>
