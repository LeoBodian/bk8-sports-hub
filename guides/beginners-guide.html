      <section id="what-is">
        <h2>What Is Sports Betting and How Does It Work?</h2>
        <p>Think of sports betting as predicting the outcome of a game or match, just like picking the winner in a friendly match with friends, but with real stakes. You place money on your prediction, and if it's correct, you earn a profit.</p>
        
        <div class="tip-box">
          <strong>Example:</strong> You bet on your favorite football team to win. If they win, you receive your initial stake plus winnings based on the odds.
        </div>
        
        <p>Sports betting isn't just gambling—it's about making informed decisions. The more you understand a sport, its teams, and players, the better your chances of making a successful bet.</p>
        
        <h3>How It Works</h3>
        <p>The process is simple:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Choose a sport:</strong> Football, basketball, tennis, esports, or others.</li>
          <li><strong>Select a match or event:</strong> Pick a game you are familiar with.</li>
          <li><strong>Choose a bet type:</strong> Decide if you want to bet on the winner, score totals, or other options.</li>
          <li><strong>Place your wager:</strong> Enter your stake amount.</li>
          <li><strong>Wait for the result:</strong> Watch the match or check the outcome online.</li>
          <li><strong>Collect your winnings:</strong> If your prediction is correct, your BK8 account is credited automatically.</li>
        </ol>
      </section>

      <section id="odds">
        <h2>Understanding Betting Odds: A Simple Guide</h2>
        
        <h3>Decimal Odds</h3>
        <p>In Asia, decimal odds are the most common. Decimal odds show how much you will receive for every unit staked, including your original stake.</p>
        
        <div class="tip-box">
          <strong>Example:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Decimal odds: 2.5</li>
            <li>Stake: $10</li>
            <li>Total payout if you win: $25 (your $10 stake + $15 profit)</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        
        <p>Decimal odds are straightforward and beginner-friendly. The higher the number, the less likely the outcome, but the bigger the potential reward.</p>
        
        <h3>What Odds Numbers Mean</h3>
        <p>Odds reflect probability. A team with low odds is more likely to win, while a team with higher odds is less likely.</p>
        
        <div class="tip-box">
          <strong>Example:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Team A: 1.4 → favorite</li>
            <li>Team B: 4.5 → underdog</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Understanding this helps you decide where the best value lies for your bet.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h3>How to Calculate Potential Winnings</h3>
        <p><strong>Formula:</strong> Stake × Odds = Total Payout</p>
        <div class="tip-box">
          <strong>Example:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Stake: $20</li>
            <li>Odds: 1.8</li>
            <li>Potential return: $36 (including your stake)</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        
        <h3>Favorites vs Underdogs</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Favorites:</strong> More likely to win, lower odds, smaller profits</li>
          <li><strong>Underdogs:</strong> Less likely to win, higher odds, bigger potential rewards</li>
        </ul>

      <section id="bet-types">
        <h2>Types of Sports Bets: Start with These Simple Bets</h2>
        
        <h3>1. Match Winner (1X2)</h3>
        <p>Predict the winner of a match: "1" for home, "X" for draw, and "2" for away. Simple and perfect for beginners.</p>
        
        <h3>2. Over/Under (Total Goals)</h3>
        <p>Predict whether total goals/points will be over or under a set number.</p>
        <div class="tip-box">
          <strong>Example:</strong> Over 2.5 goals means three or more goals must be scored. Under 2.5 means two or fewer goals.
        </div>
        
        <h3>3. Double Chance</h3>
        <p>Covers two outcomes with one bet, reducing risk. For example, bet on home win or draw.</p>
        
        <h3>4. Both Teams to Score (BTTS)</h3>
        <p>Bet on whether both teams will score. Easy to follow, especially in football.</p>
        
        <h3>5. Accumulator Basics</h3>
        <p>Combine multiple bets for higher potential returns. All selections must win. Beginners should start with 2-3 selections to manage risk.</p>
